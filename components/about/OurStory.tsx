            In a country crippled by growing waste, a bunch of tech entrepreneurs and waste enthusiasts decided to use their expertise in disrupting the waste ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p className="text-center">
            <strong>But how?</strong><br />
            We started with a 2-year ground research, which we dub as MBA in Waste Management, with the main campus of study being Landfills and Waste Generating entities. With a goal of digitising and bridging the gaps between stakeholders, the team honed their skills and brought their vision to life.

            <strong>What happened next?</strong><br />
            Recykal was launched! In a matter of 2 years, we scaled from 2 states to 30+ States and UTs. Waste channeling went from 10,000 MT annually to 200,000 MT in 2021. Recykal Marketplace, EPR Loop, Smart Centre solution, and Deposit Refund System (DRS) took the industry by storm!
